# foodquest

A Flutter project for DALI Lab.

## Project Description

There are pieces of this idea scattered across different sites, but no single product combines all of them into one clean, interactive, real‑time tool. Here's the breakdown:

### What exists
• Numbeo: crowdsourced cost‑of‑living data (ugly UI, not personalized)
• Zillow: rental listings (not integrated with COL)
• NerdWallet / SmartAsset: tax calculators (not city‑specific or integrated with COL)
• A few "compare city cost of living" blog tools, mostly static and outdated

### What doesn't exist
• A full-stack web app that:
– lets you compare two cities
– calculates salary equivalence based on your actual lifestyle profile
– merges rent + COL + taxes + transportation + utilities
– uses real APIs (not static CSVs)
– shows personalized breakdowns for your categories
– includes graphs for rent trends, tax impacts, etc.
– updates automatically as APIs update

This makes it novel and useful, because:

The existing tools are:
• not personalized
• old or crowdsourced
• missing rent API integration
• missing tax API integration
• missing salary equivalence calculations
• missing modern UI/UX
• not full-stack apps—mostly static calculators

Your version would be the first to combine:
COL + rent data + taxes + lifestyle modeling + salary conversion
into one product.
